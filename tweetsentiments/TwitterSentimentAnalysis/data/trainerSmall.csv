|negative|,|plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . |
|negative|,|they get into an accident . |
|negative|,|one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . |
|negative|,|what's the deal ? |
|negative|,|watch the movie and " sorta " find out . . . |
|negative|,|critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . |
|negative|,|which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . |
|negative|,|they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . |
|negative|,|so what are the problems with the movie ? |
|negative|,|well , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . |
|negative|,|it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . |
|negative|,|there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . |
|negative|,|now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . |
|negative|,|it's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . |
|negative|,|and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? |
|negative|,|not really . |
|negative|,|the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . |
|negative|,|i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is " into it " even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . |
|negative|,|i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! |
|negative|,|okay , we get it . . . there |
|negative|,|are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . |
|negative|,|do we really need to see it over and over again ? |
|negative|,|how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? |
|negative|,|apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . |
|negative|,|there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess " the suits " decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . |
|negative|,|the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . |
|negative|,|but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . |
|negative|,|overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . |
|negative|,|oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's |
|negative|,|just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . |
|negative|,|it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . |
|negative|,|whatever . . . skip |
|negative|,|it ! |
|negative|,|where's joblo coming from ? |
|negative|,|a nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) |
|negative|,|the happy bastard's quick movie review |
|negative|,|damn that y2k bug . |
|negative|,|it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . |
|negative|,|little do they know the power within . . . |
|negative|,|going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . |
|negative|,|we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . |
|negative|,|here , it's just " hey , let's chase these people around with some robots " . |
|negative|,|the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . |
|negative|,|you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . |
|negative|,|sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . |
|negative|,|the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . |
|negative|,|so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . |
|negative|,|otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . |
|negative|,|it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . |
|negative|,|based on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . |
|positive|,|be forewarned . |
|positive|,|the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . |
|positive|,|it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . |
|positive|,|the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . |
|positive|,|both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . |
|positive|,|however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . |
|positive|,|the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . |
|positive|,|the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . |
|positive|,|for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . |
|positive|,|my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one . |
|positive|,|my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . |
|positive|,|in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too . |
|positive|,|the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . |
|positive|,|throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . |
|positive|,|there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . |
|positive|,|my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . |
|positive|,|this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . |
|positive|,|even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding . |
|positive|,|with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . |
|positive|,|she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of " i just don't know what to do with myself " . |
|positive|,|rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . |
|positive|,|his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . |
|positive|,|dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . |
|positive|,|when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as " america's sweetheart " by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . |
|positive|,|while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . |
|positive|,|my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy . |
|positive|,|robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style . |
|positive|,|the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force . |
|positive|,|1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike . |
|positive|,|to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city . |
|positive|,|on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one . |
|positive|,| ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . ) |
|positive|,|after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i . |
|positive|,|recruits his remains for their new " robocop " program . |
|positive|,|using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal . |
|positive|,|the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i . |
|positive|,|engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) . |
|positive|,|with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i . |
|positive|,|envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems . |
|positive|,|the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers . |
|positive|,|as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective . |
|positive|,|dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects . |
|positive|,|several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics . |
|positive|,|because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater . |
|positive|,|although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre . |
|positive|,|rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society . |
|positive|,|the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors . |
|positive|,|these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore . |
|positive|,|the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood . |
|positive|,|1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society . |
|positive|,|the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd . |
|positive|,|verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary . |
