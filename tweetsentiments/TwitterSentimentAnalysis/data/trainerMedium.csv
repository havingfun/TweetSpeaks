|negative|,|i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . |
|negative|,|i just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . |
|negative|,|sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . |
|negative|,|the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . |
|negative|,|too bad it's not fun to watch when it's happening to us . . . while |
|negative|,|we sit through this mess of a film . |
|negative|,|u-turn is not a bad film if you're a fan of technique . |
|negative|,|it's the oliver stone you've always known . |
|negative|,|robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . |
|negative|,|but pictures of what ? |
|negative|,|i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . |
|negative|,|plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years . |
|negative|,|oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . |
|negative|,|you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . |
|negative|,|your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it . |
|negative|,|and i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . |
|negative|,|that's fine . |
|negative|,|but don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one . |
|negative|,|do some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) |
|negative|,|do a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world . |
|negative|,|but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as " an oliver stone movie , " and not question why it stinks like week-old snook . |
|negative|,|there's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun . |
|negative|,|this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail . |
|negative|,|there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . |
|negative|,|one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . |
|negative|,|two is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta . |
|negative|,|to wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . |
|negative|,|a science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . |
|negative|,|sci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . |
|negative|,|battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes . |
|negative|,|here's the `plot . ' |
|negative|,|the year is 3000 . |
|negative|,|mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . |
|negative|,|a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . |
|negative|,|the psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . |
|negative|,|a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' |
|negative|,|he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . |
|negative|,|after several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . |
|negative|,|jonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . |
|negative|,|then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . |
|negative|,|the whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . |
|negative|,|roger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . |
|negative|,|and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . |
|negative|,|christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! |
|negative|,|and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . |
|negative|,|the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . |
|negative|,|travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . |
|negative|,|jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! ' |
|negative|,|then there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve . |
|negative|,|why ? |
|negative|,|because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid . ' |
|negative|,|terel may be right , you know . |
|negative|,|humans made this movie . |
|negative|,|would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? |
|negative|,|let me tell you what reality is . |
|negative|,|reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . |
|negative|,|that's reality . |
|negative|,|america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . |
|negative|,|the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time . |
|negative|,|the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . |
|negative|,|gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . |
|negative|,|veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all . |
|negative|,| ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) |
|negative|,|and did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? |
|negative|,|and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? |
|negative|,|oh billy , you're a scamp ! |
|negative|,|the script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? |
|negative|,|and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one . |
|negative|,|yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! |
|negative|,|if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . |
|negative|,|it's about to expire . |
|negative|,|aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , |
|negative|,|america's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . |
|negative|,|i didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . |
|negative|,|bad move , billy -- your jokes suck . |
|negative|,|the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . |
|negative|,|julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . |
|negative|,|obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . |
|negative|,|none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho . |
|negative|,|as for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . |
|negative|,|he's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . |
|negative|,|it'll probably be another 11 before he's back again . |
|negative|,|i could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . |
|negative|,|instead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . |
|negative|,|every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . |
|negative|,|when you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? |
|negative|,|rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . |
|negative|,|starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . |
|negative|,|running time : 117 minutes |
|negative|,|directed by : christian duguay |
|negative|,|i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career . |
|negative|,|he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . |
|negative|,|his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled " blade " . |
|negative|,|he has had his typical action movies , " boiling point " , " passenger 57 " , but his new movie " the art of war " should just be called " rising sun 2 : the art of war " cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . |
|negative|,|wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . |
|negative|,|anne archer plays his " boss " type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . |
|negative|,|well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . |
|negative|,|all this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . |
|negative|,|wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . |
|negative|,|the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's " blade " . |
|positive|,|or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? |
|positive|,|like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . |
|positive|,|and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect . |
|positive|,|i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . |
|positive|,|and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . |

|positive|,|capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities . |
|positive|,|mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness . |
|positive|,|you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india . |
|positive|,|the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable . |
|positive|,| , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) |
|positive|,|mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . |
|positive|,|her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi . |
|positive|,|a wealthy family is having a wedding . |
|positive|,|an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial . |
|positive|,|even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together . |
|positive|,|the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines . |
|positive|,|aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us . |
|positive|,|she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor . |
|positive|,|latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey . |
|positive|,|dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration . |
|positive|,|even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants . |
|positive|,|several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both . |
|positive|,|there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love . |
|positive|,|some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films . |
|positive|,|western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna . |
|positive|,|on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films . |
|positive|,|this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english . |
|positive|,|the latter will , however , help with an international release . |
|positive|,|sabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog . |
|positive|,|we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference . |
|positive|,|director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life . |
|positive|,|i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . |
|positive|,|the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . |
|positive|,|thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . |
|positive|,|through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . |
|positive|,|life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . |
|positive|,|living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . |
|positive|,|although dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . |
|positive|,|unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . |
|positive|,|it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest . |
|positive|,|although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness . |
|positive|,|now , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . |
|positive|,|benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . |
|positive|,|the supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . |
|positive|,|life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . |
|positive|,|in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a " saturday night live " spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious . |
|positive|,|characters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome . |
|positive|,|in all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first " artsy " film . |
|positive|,|life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . |
|positive|,|while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . |
|positive|,|the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . |
|positive|,|schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like " serpico " and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . |
|positive|,|on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour . |
|positive|,|unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her . |
|positive|,|max is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . |
|positive|,|as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from " the wonder years " , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . |
|positive|,|hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . |
|positive|,|bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him . |
|positive|,|while this isn't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . |
|positive|,|williams isn't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . |
|positive|,|rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn't a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . |
|positive|,|anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success . |
|positive|,|no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , " jude the obscure , " his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . |
|positive|,|but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . |
|positive|,| " jude " is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is . |
|positive|,|the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) . |
|positive|,|it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from " shallow grave " ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . |
|positive|,|in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . |
|positive|,|after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . |
|positive|,|taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . |
|positive|,|but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . |
|positive|,|another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . |
|positive|,|she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . |
|positive|,|several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . |
|positive|,|because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . |
|positive|,|if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . |
|positive|,|the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . |
|positive|,|he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . |
|positive|,|part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible . |
|positive|,|but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . |
|positive|,|the ending of " jude " is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . |
|positive|,| " jude " offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't . |
|positive|,|there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . |
|positive|,|satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what " jude " is . |
|positive|,|sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . |
|positive|,|the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . |
|positive|,|christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . |
|positive|,|kate winslet , in a pre- " titanic " performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality . |
|positive|,|kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see " titanic , " branagh's " hamlet , " " sense and sensibility , " and " heavenly creatures , " the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . |
|positive|,|in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces . |
|positive|,| " jude " moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . |
|positive|,|but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate " jude , " though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . |
|positive|,|quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie . |
|positive|,|he runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain . |
|positive|,|eventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal . |
|positive|,|since he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it . |
|positive|,|their scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money . |
|positive|,|instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl . |
|positive|,|of course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time . |
|positive|,|you could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined . |
